## Analysis
As seen in the first line of the log: <code>Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000</code>; this error message is caused by the kernel attempting to dereference a NULL pointer.  

The mem abort info and data abort info specify the register information at the time of the fault. 
The line <code>CPU: 0 PID: 159 Comm: sh Tainted: G           O      5.15.18 #1</code> denotes the CPU on which the fault occurred; the PID and process name causing the OOPS with the PID and Comm field; and the Tainted: 'G' flag specifies that the kernel was tainted by loading a proprietary module.

<code> pc : faulty_write+0x14/0x20 [faulty]</code> provides the program counter value at the time of the oops. Based on this line, we can deduce that the oops message occurred when executing the faulty_write function. The byte offset at which the crash occurred is 0x14 or 20 bytes into the function while the length of the function is denoted by 0x20 or 32 bytes. 

The Link register and stack pointer contents are displayed as well in the subsequent lines. Following these values are the CPU register contents and the call trace. The call trace provides the list of functions that were called before the oops occurred. The <code> Code: </code> section provides a hex-dump of the machine code that was executing at the time the oops occurred.
